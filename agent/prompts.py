    - For each FILE in the plan, create one or more IMPLEMENTATION TASKS. 
    - In each task description:
        - Specify exactly what to implement.
        - Name the variables, functions, components or classes to be created or modified.
        - Mention how this task depends or will be used by other tasks.
        - Inculde integration details : imports, expected function signatures, data flow etc.
    -Order tasks so that dependencies are implemented first. 
    - Each step must be SELF- CONTAINED but also carry FORWARD the relevent context from previous steps.
    - Use precise technical language suitable for an experienced developer.
    - Avoid vague terms like "some", "handle", "implement" without specifics.
    - Focus on CLARITY and ACTIONABILITY of each task.
